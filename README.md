# CompilerDesignLab
A collection of lab programs for the Compiler Design Lab (KTU S6 CSE – 2019 Scheme).
# Compiler Lab Programs - KTU S7 (2019 Scheme)

A curated collection of C programs for the **Compiler Lab** as per the APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU) S7 2019 Scheme. Each program is cleanly documented, fully functional, and tailored for hands-on lab work, learning, and exam readiness.

## 1. Infix to Postfix & Three Address Code Generator
- Converts infix expressions to postfix.
- Automatically generates three-address code.
- Demonstrates syntax-directed translation.

## 2. Shift-Reduce Parser
- Implements a classic bottom-up parser.
- Step-by-step visualization of shift and reduce actions for a simple grammar.

## 3. Recursive Descent Parser
- Top-down parsing of expressions.
- Functions match grammar rules for easy learning and debugging.

## 4. C Token Identifier
- Reads a C source and classifies tokens as:
    - Keywords
    - Identifiers
    - Numbers
    - Special symbols
- Also counts the number of lines.

## 5. FIRST and FOLLOW Set Calculator
- Computes FIRST and FOLLOW sets for a given grammar.
- Essential for LL(1) parser construction.

## 6. Constant Folding and Propagation
- Detects and computes constant expressions at compile time.
- Propagates computed constants to optimize quadruple-based code.

## 7. Epsilon Closure of NFA States
- Reads epsilon transitions from a file.
- Calculates and displays epsilon closure for each NFA state.
- Useful in NFA to DFA conversion.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone** or **Download** the repository.
2. Each `.c` file represents an individual, self-contained program.
3. Compile using any C compiler. For example:
    ```
    gcc filename.c -o outputfile
    ./outputfile
    ```
4. Follow the prompts or see the code comments for any required input.  
   > Note: For the epsilon closure program, prepare an `input.dat` file as described in the program comments.

---

## ✨ Highlights

- Programs are **fully commented** for fast understanding.
- Compliant with **KTU 2019 Scheme** lab requirements.
- Great for lab practice, assignments, and interviews.
- Readily executable on standard C compilers (e.g., GCC).
